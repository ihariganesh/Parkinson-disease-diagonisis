# How to Improve Your Diagnosis Metrics - Quick Summary

## 📊 Your Current Results

```
Diagnosis: Healthy ✅
PD Probability: 42.2% ⚠️ (borderline - goal: <30%)
Confidence: 42.1% ⚠️ (low - goal: >70%)
Modality Agreement: 82% ✅ (high - good!)
```

## 🎯 What These Numbers Mean

### 1. **PD Probability: 42.2%**
- This is **how likely** you have Parkinson's Disease
- **42.2% = LOW RISK** (below 50% threshold)
- **Goal: Get this below 30%** for strong healthy indication

### 2. **Confidence: 42.1%** 
- This is **how certain** the AI is about the diagnosis
- **42.1% = LOW CONFIDENCE** (system is uncertain)
- **Goal: Get this above 70%** for reliable diagnosis

### 3. **Modality Agreement: 82%**
- This shows **how much the three tests agree**
- **82% = HIGH AGREEMENT** ✅ (all tests say "healthy")
- This is already excellent - keep it up!

## 🔴 PRIORITY #1: Improve Voice Analysis (BIGGEST IMPACT!)

### Why Focus Here?
```
Your Voice Results:
- Probability: 71% ⚠️ (HIGHEST - pulling your overall score UP)

```

**This ONE modality is dragging down your overall results!**

### Quick Fix (This Week):

1. **Get Better Equipment**
   - Buy USB microphone ($20-50)

   ✅ Close microphone (6-12 inches from mouth)
   ✅ Say "Aaaaaaaah" for 15 seconds
   ✅ Maintain steady volume and pitch
   ✅ Record 5 different samples
   ✅ Upload the clearest ones
   ```

3. **Common Mistakes to Avoid**
   ```
   ❌ Recording with background noise
   ❌ Being too far from microphone
   ❌ Recording when tired or stressed
   ❌ Using low-quality phone mic
   ❌ Recording in echoey room
   ```

**Expected Result:** 
- Voice probability drops from 71% → 35%
